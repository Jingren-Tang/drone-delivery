Data contains observations of real life traffic.
The frequency is 1 observation per second.

Variables index:

ID: Vehicle ID
Time: Observation timestamp
Position: Longitudinal position of the vehicle
Length: Vehicle length
Width: Vehicle width
Type: Vehicle type
Speed: Vehicle speed (m/s)
Acceleration: Vehicle acceleration (m/s^2)
Lane: Vehicle lane
Leader: ID of the lead vehicle
Follower: ID of the following vehicle
Space_headway: Spacing distance with lead vehicle (m)
Time_headway: Time distance with lead vehicle (s)
Acceleration_lead: Acceleration of lead vehicle
Speed_lead: Speed of lead vehicle
Position_lead: Longitudinal position of lead vehicle
Density: Average traffic density in the next 100m
distanceToEnd: Distance to the end of the observation area
lane_change: dummy variable that takes value 1 if a lane change is observed
lead_change: dummy variable that takes value 1 if the lead vehicle changes
lag_leader*: the ID of the lead vehicle * seconds ago
lag_lane*: the vehicle lane * seconds ago
lag_acceleration*: acceleration * seconds ago
lag_speed*: speed * seconds ago
lag_position*: longitudinal position * seconds ago
lag_s_headway*: Space headway * seconds ago


The remaining variables are irrelevant to the car-following model context
