Specify and estimate the latent class model as defined in the lecutre slides.

- For the utility of the latent states, only consider relative speed (lagged) as an explanatory variable
- Consider only the positive relative speed values for the acceleration state.
- Consider only the negative relative speed values for the deceleration state.

- For the acceleration and deceleration states consider the GM model.
- For the do nothing car-following model estimate only a constant (and not the GM model).
